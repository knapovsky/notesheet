[Verse]
C           G      Am                  F
   Said I remember when we used to sit
C                    G       Am         F
   In the government yard in Trenchtown
C         G         Am             F
   Oba, oba-serving the hypocrites
        C            G                    Am        F
As they would mingle with the good people we meet   (Yeah...)
C                  G         Am                F
   Good friends we have, oh good friends we've lost
C      G         Am       F
       along the way    (Yeah...)
C           G               Am                F
   In this great future you can't forget your past
C      G               Am        F
   So dry your tears I say

[Chorus]
 C     G             Am F
And No woman, no cry
   C  Fm7 Am7  Dm  C        G
   No  woman,  no cry
C               G             Am       F
   Dear Little darlin, don't shed no tears
   C  Fm7 Am7  Dm  C        G
   No  woman,  no cry
G
Said, said...

[Verse]
C           G      Am                  F
   Said I remember when we used to sit
C                    G       Am          F
   In the government yard in Trenchtown
C              G              Am         F
And then Georgie would make the fire lights,
         C             G                   Am      F
as it was, like a wood burnin' through the night
C                G              Am         F
   Then we would cook cornmeal porridge
C              G         Am         F
Of which I'll share with you, (oooh).
C     G          Am        F
   My feet is my only carriage
C              G          Am
So I've got to push on through.
               F
But, while I'm gone, I mean

[Bridge]
C                  G
Everything's gonna be all right!
Am                 Fm7
Everything's gonna be all right,
C                  G
Everything's gonna be all right!
Am                 Fm7
Everything's gonna be all right, I say
C                  G
Everything's gonna be all right!
Am                 Fm7
Everything's gonna be all right,
C                  G

Am                 Fm7

   No  woman,  no cry
C               G      Am              F
   oh no Little sister,  don't shed no tears
   C  Fm7 Am7  Dm  C        G
   No  woman,  no cry
