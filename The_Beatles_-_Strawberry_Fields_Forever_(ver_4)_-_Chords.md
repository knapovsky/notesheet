[Intro]

| E* Emaj7 | E7     | F#m* E* | D* A*  |


[Chorus 1]

A
  Let me take you down,
                Em7
cause Im going to
Em7
Strawberry fields
F#7
  Nothing is real
    D              F#7
And nothing to get hung about
D                    A
Strawberry fields forever


[Verse 1]

E*        Emaj7     E7
Living is easy with eyes closed
F#m      E               D
Misunderstanding all you see
D            E               A
 Its getting hard to be someone,
                  F#m
but it all works out
D          E              D   A
 It doesnt matter much to me


[Chorus 2]

A
  Let me take you down,
                Em7
cause Im going to
Em7
Strawberry fields
F#7
  Nothing is real
    D              F#7
And nothing to get hung about
D                    A
Strawberry fields forever


[Verse 2]

E*        Emaj7        E7
No one, I think, is in my tree
F#m         E               D
 I mean, it must be high or low
D             E                     A
 That is, you can't, you know, tune in,
          F#m
But its alright
D           E                 D   A
 That is, I think its not too bad


[Chorus 3]

A
  Let me take you down,
                Em7
cause Im going to
Em7
Strawberry fields
F#7
  Nothing is real
    D              F#7
And nothing to get hung about
D                    A
Strawberry fields forever


[Verse 3]

E*      Emaj7   E7
Always, no, sometimes, think its me
F#m               E               D
 But, you know, I know when its a dream
D             E               A
 I think, er, no, I mean, er, yes,
            F#m
But its all wrong
D           E            D   A
 That is, I think I disagree


[Chorus 4]

A
  Let me take you down,
                Em7
cause Im going to
Em7
Strawberry fields
F#7
  Nothing is real
    D              F#7
And nothing to get hung about
D                    A     F#m
Strawberry fields forever
D                    A
Strawberry fields forever
D          E         D
Strawberry fields forever
