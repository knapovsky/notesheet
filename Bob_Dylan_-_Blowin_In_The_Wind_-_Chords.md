[Verse]
G        C            D        G
How many roads must a man walk down, before you
C          G    G        C           D
call him a man, How many seas must a white dove
G               C             D             G
sail before she sleeps in the sand, Yes and how
     C              D           G
many times must the cannonballs fly before they're
C       G
forever banned,

[Chorus]
C            D         G                C
The answer my friend  is blowin' in the wind
              D              G
The answer is blowin' in the wind

[Harmonica refrain]
C D G C  D G

[Verse]
        G        C           D         G
Yes and how many years can a mountain exist
             C             G            G
before it is washed to the sea, Yes and how
     C              D      G
many years can some people exist before
        C             D             G
they're allowed to be free, Yes and how many
C           D            G
times can a man turn his head and pretend
         C           G
that he just doesn't see

[Chorus]
C            D         G                C
The answer my friend  is blowin' in the wind
              D             G
The answer is blowin in the wind

[Harmonica refrain]
C D G C  D G

[Verse]
        G        C           D        G
Yes and how many time must a man look up
              C       G             G
before he can see the sky,  Yes and how
     C         D       G
many ears must one man have before he can
C           D            G        C
hear people cry, yes and how many deaths will
   D            G                   C
it take till he knows that too many people have
     G
have died

[Chorus]
C            D           G              C
The answer my friend  is blowin' in the wind
              D              G
The answer is blowin' in the wind

[Harmonica refrain]
