Capo 1

[Verse]
F   C   G                C/G
Chained to the wall of our room
          F                            C
Yeah, you chained me like a dog in our room
  G                                        C/G
I thought that’s how it was, I thought that we were fine
F                C
Then the day was night
        G                               Am          F    C
You were high, you were high while I was doomed and dying for
        G
With no life, with no light.

[Instrumental]
F  C  G  C/G

[Chorus]
F         C       Am                  C/G
Tied to my bed, I was younger then, I had nothing to spend
    F        C
but time on you
                G                               Am   F   C/G
But it made me love it made me love, it made me love more
                G                               Am   F   C/G   G
But it made me love it made me love, it made me love more

[Verse]
F                               C
Do what you said, the words she said – left out
G                       C/G
Over into the sky where i’ll soon fly
F                   C
And she took the time
Am                                      G    F  C
to believe in, to believe in what she said
             Am                                 G    F   C/G
She made me love, she made me love, she made me love more
             Am                                 G    F   C/G
She made me love, she made me love, she made me love more

[Outro]
Am G    F Cm     Am G    F Cm      Am G       F C Am G F
More    More     More    More      More
