(Originally transcribed by Sandy Butler - all credit to him)

This is the exact version of Coldplay's 'See You Soon', watch the Live 2003 DVD to see
this proved...It's a great song and impossible to find a good tab for, so I thought I'd
put it on here. Listen to the record for the strumming and the hammer-ons.

C#m Bsus4/D#  E         Badd11
So  you       lost your trust
                     C#m
And you never should have
  Bsus4/D#  E          Badd11
No you    never should have

Well if you ever hear this, don't     answer that

I'll be  doing  my    best and I'll see you soon
A        Amaj7  Aadd9 Amaj7
    In a tele   scope lens

 So they      came for you

They came snapping at your heels
     Bsus4/D#  E               Badd11
They came      snapping at your heels
C#m   Bsus4/D#  E          Badd11
  But don't     break your back
