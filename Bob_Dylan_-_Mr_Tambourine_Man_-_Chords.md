[Intro]

D        D Dsus2 D x2


[Verse]

G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
        D                G               A         Asus4 A
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
       D             G                 A         D   Dsus4 D Dsus2 D
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.

          G                  A          D            G
Though I know that evenin's empire has returned into sand,
  D               G
Vanished from my hand,
          D               G                   A     Asus4 A
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.
   G          A             D             G
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
  D              G
I have no one to meet
         D              G                     A     Asus4 A
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.


[Chorus]

G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
        D                G               A         Asus4 A
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
       D             G                 A         D   Dsus4 D Dsus2 D
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.


[Verse]

G            A              D              G
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship,
   D                G            D                   G
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip,
   D                G          D           G
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
      A
To be wanderin'.
    G           A             D            G
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
  D           G               D                G
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way,
                A
I promise to go under it.


[Chorus]

G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
        D                G               A         Asus4 A
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
       D             G                 A         D   Dsus4 D Dsus2 D
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.


[Verse]

           G                    A                  D                G
Though you might hear laughin', spinnin', swingin' madly across the sun,
         D           G                D             G
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escapin' on the run
                D         G             A
And but for the sky there are no fences facin'.
    G                 A         D                 G
And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme
   D                G            D                   G
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind,
   D                G            D                   G
I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're seein'
          A
That he's chasing.


[Chorus]

G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
        D                G               A         Asus4 A
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
       D             G                 A         D   Dsus4 D Dsus2 D
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.

[Verse]

     G            A                   D                 G
Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind,
         D              G         D               G
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,
    D                   G          D            G
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,
    D                G              A
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
        G                 A                D               G
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
     D             G            D             G
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,
         D          G           D                G
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,
          D          G            A
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.


[Chorus]

G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
        D                G               A         Asus4 A
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
       D             G                 A         D   Dsus4 D Dsus2 D
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.
