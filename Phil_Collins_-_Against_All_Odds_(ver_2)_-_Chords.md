[Intro]

Dm     G    x2


[Verse]

Am                     Bm
How can I just let you walk away
             C               Dm
Just let you leave without a trace,
       F                 G                 Em   Am
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh.
           Dm           F                 G
You're the only one who really knew me at all.
Am                    Bm
How can you just walk away from me,
         C                     Dm
When all I can do is watch you leave,
            F                   G
Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain,
    Em              Am
And even shared the tears.
           Dm           F                 G      G7
You're the only one who really knew me at all.


[Chorus]
                     C
So take a look at me now
                      D
Cause there's just an empty space,
            Am                   F
And there's nothing left here to remind me,
         Dm             G
Just the memory of your face.
          G7         C
Oh take a look at me now
                      D
Cause there's just an empty space,
               Am            F
And you coming back to me is against the odds,
           Dm               G        G7
And that's what I've got to face.


[Verse]

  Am                         Bm
I wish I could just make you turn around,
C                      Dm
Turn around and see me cry,
           F              G
There's so much I need to say to you,
   Em           Am
So many reasons why.
           Dm           F                 G       G7
You're the only one who really knew me at all.


[Chorus]

                     C
So take a look at me now
                      D
Cause there's just an empty space,
            Am                   F
And there's nothing left here to remind me,
         Dm             G
Just the memory of your face.

          G7         C
Oh take a look at me now
                      D
Cause there's just an empty space,
       Am                        F
But to wait for you, well that's all I can do,
           Dm               G
And that's what I've got to face.
            G7         C
Take a good look at me now
                    D
Cause I'll still be standing here,
               Am            F
And you coming back to me is against all odds,
         Dm                 G       G7
It's the chance I've got to take


[Outro]

Dm    G    Dm   G

G7         Dm     G
Take a look at me now.
