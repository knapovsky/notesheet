[Intro]

G Cadd9 Am7 C C D G


[Verse 1]

G          Cadd9
Saying I love you is
Am7             C       D         G
not the words I want to hear from you
G                Cadd9
It's not that I want you
Am7            C      D    Em
not to say but if you only knew
Bm7   Am7
Ho-ow ea-sy
D              G      D/F#     Em
It would be to show me how you feel
Bm7       Am7       D7              G7
More than words  is all you have to do
G7              C
To make it real
C         Cm              G
Then you wouldn't have to say
          Em7
That you love me 'cos
Am7   D7    G
I'd already know


[Chorus]

G                 D/F#   Em        Bm      C
What would you do if my heart was torn in two
C                    G/B     Am7             D7                G
More than words to show you feel that your love for me is real
G                   D/F#  Em7        Bm7    C
What would you say if I took those words away?
C                     G/B      Am7
Then you couldn't make things new
         D7             G
Just by saying I love you


[Interlude]

G Cadd9 Am7 C C D G (x2)


[Verse 2]

G          Cadd9
Now that I've tried to
Am7             C       D         G
Talk to you and make you understand
G                Cadd9
All that you have to do is
Am7            C               D          Em
Close your eyes and just reach out your hands
Bm7   Am7
And touch me
D              G      D/F#     Em
Hold me close don't ever let me go
Bm7      Am7
More than words
D7           G7                 C
Is all I ever needed you to show
C        Cm                   G
Then you wouldn't have to say
          Em7
That you love me 'cos
Am7   D7    G
I'd already know


[Chorus]

G                 D/F#   Em        Bm      C
What would you do if my heart was torn in two
C                    G/B     Am7             D7                G
More than words to show you feel that your love for me is real
G                   D/F#  Em7        Bm7    C
What would you say if I took those words away?
C                     G/B      Am7
Then you couldn't make things new
   D7             G
Just by saying I love you
