[Intro]

G, Am7, Cmaj7, Am7


[Verse 1]

G
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
Am7
I touch on you more and more every time
Cmaj7
When you leave, I'm begging you not to go
Am7
Call your name two or three times in a row
G
It's a funny thing for me to try to explain
Am7
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
Cmaj7
'Cause I know I don't understand
Am7
Just how your love can do what no one else can


[Chorus]
(Hit bass note one beat one then strum on beat two etc...)

G
Got me looking so crazy right now
      Am7
your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Cmaj7
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Am7
  Got me looking so crazy right now
G
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Am7
  Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Cmaj7
Looking so crazy in love's
                       Am7
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love

G
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no
Am7
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no
Cmaj7
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no
Am7
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh,


[Verse 2]

G
When I talk to my friends so quietly
Am7
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me
Cmaj7
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
Am7
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
G
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
Am7
It's the beat my heart skips when I'm with you
Cmaj7
'Cause  I still don't understand
Am7
Just how your love can do what no one else can


[Chorus]

G
Got me looking so crazy right now
      Am7
your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Cmaj7
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Am7
  Got me looking so crazy right now
G
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Am7
  Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Cmaj7
Looking so crazy in love's
                       Am7
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love

G
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no
Am7
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no
Cmaj7
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no
Am7
Uh oh, uh oh,


[Bridge]

Am7               Cmaj7
Got me looking so crazy, my baby
    Am7                    Cmaj7
I'm not myself; lately I'm foolish, I don't do this
          Am7                   Cmaj7   A
I've been playing myself; baby, I don't care
            G
'Cause your love's got the best of me
                   Am7
And, baby, you're making a fool of me
              Cmaj7
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
                   Am7                 Cmaj7
'Cause, baby, you got me, you got me goin crazy,
G
Ahh, ohh
Am7
Ahh, ohh
Cmaj7
Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
