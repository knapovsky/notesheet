[Intro]

D A E          
Bm D A E


[Verse]

D             A              E
   There is a house built out of stone
D             A                E
   Wooden floors, walls and window sills...
D                 A             E
   Tables and chairs worn by all of the dust...
Bm            D                 A          E
   This is a place where I don't feel alone
Bm               D             A       E
   This is a place where I feel at home...

[interlude]

D Amaj7 D A E


[Chorus]

     D Amaj7     D        A         E
And, I built a home  for you    for me
   D      Amaj7   D        A           E
Until it disappeared from me    from you        
     D        Amaj7   D F#m     A       E
And now, it's time to live and turn to dust........

[Interlude]

D A E
Bm D A E


[Verse]

D            A                E
Out in the garden where we planted the seeds
Bm           D      A      E
There is a tree as old as me
D               A          E
Branches were sewn by the color of green
Bm           D          A            E
Ground had arose and passed it's knees
  
       D             A          E
By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top
Bm             D       A      E
I climbed the tree to see the world
         D            A         E
When the gusts came around to blow me down
Bm              D            A        E
I held on as tightly as you held onto me
Bm              D            A        E
I held on as tightly as you held onto me......

[interlude]

D Amaj7 D A E

[Chorus]

     D Amaj7     D        A         E
And, I built a home  for you    for me
   D      Amaj7   D        A           E
Until it disappeared from me    from you        
    D         Amaj7   D F#m     A       E
And now, it's time to live and turn to dust........

[Ending]
