[Intro]

Am (Palm Mute)


[Verse]

Am                  E
There's a fire starting in my heart,
G                                                E          G
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

Am              E
Finally, I can see you crystal clear.

G                                     E                 G
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare.

Am                          E
See how I leave, with every piece of you
G                          E                   G
Don't underestimate the things that I will do.
Am                E
There's a fire starting in my heart,
G                                E                        G
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

F                       G
The scars of your love, remind me of us.
Em                      F
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
F                       G
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
Em              E
I can't help feeling...


[Chorus]

E                            Am                              G
We could have had it all... (I wish you, never had met me)...
F (hold)
          G
Rolling in the Deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Am                                                                       G
Your had my heart... (I wish you)... Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
F (hold)
                                   G
And you played it... (Tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (Rolling in the deep)


[Verse]

Am                    E
Baby I have no story to be told,
           G                            E                              G
But I've heard one of you and I'm gonna make your head burn.
Am                      E
Think of me in the depths of your despair.
 G                                          E
                G
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared.

F                  G                   Em
The scars of your love, remind me of us.
                       F
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
F                       G                      Em
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
             E
I can't help feeling...


[Chorus]

E                            Am                              G
We could have had it all... (I wish you, never had met me)...
F (hold)
          G
Rolling in the Deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Am                                                                              G
Your had my heart... (I wish you)... Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
F (hold)
                                   G
And you played it... (Tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (Rolling in the deep)


F                                 G
We could have had it all
Am                          G
Rolling in the Deep
F
Your had my heart Inside of your hand
G
And you played it To the beat


[Bridge]

Am (hold)
Throw yourself through ever open door (Whoa)

Count your blessings to find what look for (Whoa-uh)

Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Whoa)

And pay me back in kind- You reap just what you sow.


[Chorus]

Am                             G
(I wish you... Never had met me)
F                                                       G
We could have had it all (Tears are gonna fall... Rolling in the deep)
Am                                                              G
We could have had it all yeah ( I wish you... never had met me)
F (hold)
It all. (Tears are gonna fall)
                                           G
It all, It all (Rolling in the deep)


Am                                         G
We could have had it all... (I wish you, never had met me)...
F                                                    G
Rolling in the Deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Am                      G
Your had my heart... (I wish you)... Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
F                               G
And you played it... (Tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (Rolling in the deep)


Am                                                G

But you played it

You played it.

You played it.
           G     End on Am
You played it to the beat.
