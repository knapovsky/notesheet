[Verse 1]

G                    D                          Em     D
   Dear Mr President, come take a walk with me
               G                          D
Let's pretend,  we're just two people and,  you're not better than me,
           Em                                 D
I'd like to, ask you some questions if we can, speak honestly.


[Pre-Chorus]

C              Am7                   G                    D
  What do you feel when you see the homeless on the street?
C              Am7                 G               D
  Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep?
C              Am7                       Em        D
  What do you feel when you look in the mirror?
           C     C
Are you proud?


[Chorus]

             G               D         Am     (Am/B)     C
How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
             G             D             Am              C
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
             G             D         Am        (Am/B)    C
How do you walk with your head held high?
               Em     D       C
Can you even look me in the eye?
		G
And tell me why


[Instrumental]

(G)  D  Em  D


[Verse 2]

G                  D
  Dear Mr President, were you a lonely boy
Em                      D
  Were you a lonely boy?
                G                        D
How can you say, no child is left behind
                                    Em
We're not dumb, and we're not blind
                                  D
They're all sitting in your cells

while you pave the road to hell


[Pre-Chorus 2]

C     	        Am7                        G                 D
What kind of father might take his own daughter's rights away?
C                 Am7                          G                   D
And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay?
C            Am7                    G          D
I can only imagine what the first lady has to say
               Em                          A
You've come a long way, from whiskey and cocaine


[Chorus]

             G               D         Am     (Am/B)     C
How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
             G             D             Am              C
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
             G             D         Am        (Am/B)    C
How do you walk with your head held high?
               Em     D         C
Can you even look me in the eye?


[Bridge]
                       Em       G
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
          Am                     C
Minimum wage with a baby on the way
                       Em         G
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
                  Am                              C
Re-building your house after the bombs took them away
                       Em        G
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
           Am                       C
Building a bed out of a cardboard box
                        Em         G          Am     Am/B   C
Let me tell you 'bout hard work, hard work, hard work
                             Em         G
You don't know nothing 'bout hard work, hard work
     C      C
Hard work!

How do you sleep at night?
Em       G       Am        C         G
How do you walk, with your head held high

G                   D                                 Em     D
  Dear Mr President  you'd never take a walk with me

ummm, would you.
