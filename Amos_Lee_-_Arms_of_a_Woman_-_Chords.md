[Intro]

(finger picking)
A - D - A - E

        A                     D
I am at ease in the arms of a woman.
         A
Although now,
                          E
most of my days are spent alone.
F#m
   A thousand miles,
                     E
from the place i was born.
             D
But when she wakes me,
    E             A
she takes me back home.


          A
Now, most days,
               D
i spend like a child.
      A                    E
Who's afraid of ghosts in my mind.
F#m                                E
   I know, there ain't nothin' out there.
    D               E             A
I'm still afraid to turn on the lights.


        A                     D
I am at ease in the arms of a woman.
          A
Although now,
                            E
most of my days a are spent alone.
F#m
   A thousand miles,
                     E
from the place i was born.
             D
But when she wakes me,
    E             A
she takes me back home.
