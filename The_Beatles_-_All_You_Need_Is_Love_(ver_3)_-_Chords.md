ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE - 1967
 The Beatles  (Lennon/McCartney)

Listen to the track to get the rhythm right. It's tricky because the verses are in 7/4.

[Verse]

G                        D                Em 
 There's nothing you can do that can't be done
G                 D                  Em   
 Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Am                G               D                  
 Nothing you can say but you can learn to play the game,
      1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 +
      D       D7      Bm      D    
 It's easy

G                        D                  Em
 There's nothing you can make that can't be made
G                D                  Em
 No one you can save that can't be saved.
Am               G               D                                   
 Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time,
      1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 +
      D       D7      Bm      D    
 It's easy


[Chorus]

G        A        D     D7     
All you need is love
G        A        D     D7
All you need is love
G        B7      Em   G    C       D       G
All you need is love love, Love is all you need.

G                        D               Em                   
 There's nothing you can know that isn't known.
G                D              Em   
 Nothing you can see that isn't shown.
Am               G              D
 Nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be,
      1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 +
      D       D7      Bm      D    
 It's easy


G        A        D     D7     
All you need is love, 
G        A        D     D7
All you need is love,
G        B7      Em   G    C       D       G
All you need is love love, Love is all you need.

G                        D               Em                   
All you need is love (all together now)
