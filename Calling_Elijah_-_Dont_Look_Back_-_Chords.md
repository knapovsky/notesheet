title: Calling Elijah - Dont Look Back
---

```
http://www.callingelijah.com/
Tuning: Standard E
Timing: 3/4

Chords:
    E   A  C#m  B   A2
e|--0---0---0---0------|
B|--0---0---0---0------|
G|--9---9---9---9---6--|
D|--9---9---9---9---7--|
A|--7---0---0---0---7--|
E|--0---x---9---7---5--|

Note that when playing the musical intermissions when playing the chords they
tend to drop the "E" note on the "G" string down a semi tone to the 8th fret,
making it a D# note, I'll quickly tab that so you know what I mean.

Don't use this as a guide to the strumming pattern, just find that yourself
(I'm horrible at trying to say how to strum, to me it just comes naturally).
You don't have to do it "by the book" either, mess around with it a little,
put some of your own favorite frills on the song.

By the way, the verses and the bridge are palm muted with the occasional lift
of the palm whilst strumming... Once again, find your own way of doing it,
I'm not going to be any help with that haha.


E                  A                     C#m    B
Do you ever wonder how you have gotten this far
E                    A                    C#m     B
Life has a habit of leaving a wound and a scar
         E                               A                   C#m       B
Well the things that have happened have told you the way it should be
      C#m                 A                   B
And I try to forget cos tomorrow is never the same
     C#m                       A                    B
As I walk to the light but the darkness is calling my name


         E                 A
Don't look back, moment is gone
                 C#m            B
Feel like you've left and moved on
         E                      A
Don't look back now that you're here
           C#m            B
All of the words that you said
              E     A    C#m    B
Don't look back


E                          A                    C#m      B
There comes a time when we need to forgive and let go
    E                              A                       C#m      B
The flowers that are choked by the thorns they are trying to grow
         C#m                           A                      B
Well you say that you're nothing, it's all that you've ever been told
         C#m                       A                       B
But your past's not your future, I want you to know that they're wrong


D
Life is too short to hold on
                      A2
Turn my back and move on
                            E
Now that I've found there's a way
        D
There's nothing for me way back here
                A2
So I'm looking ahead
                          E
I place this all back in your time.
