Am  F   Am  F
Am  F   Am  F


[VERSE I]

Am
Psychic spies from China
       F
Try to steal your mind's elation
Am
Little girls from Sweden
         F
Dream of silver screen quotations
    C                 G
And if you want these kind of dreams
     F        Dm
It's Californication
Am  F   Am  F


[VERSE II]

         Am
It's the edge of the world
           F
And all of western civilization
    Am
The sun may rise in the East
            F
At least it settles in the final location
     C               G
It's understood that Hollywood

sells Californication
Am  F   Am  F

Marry me girl be my fairy to the world

Be my very own constellation

A teenage bride with a baby inside

[VERSE IV]

Am
Space may be the final frontier
         F
But it's made in a Hollywood basement
Am
Cobain can you hear the spheres
        F
Singing songs off station to station?
     C            G
And Alderon's not far away

It's Californication
Am  F   Am  F

[VERSE V]

   Am
Destruction leads to a very rough road
       F
But it also breeds creation
    Am
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar
        F
They're just another good vibration
    C                    G
And tidal waves couldn't save the world
     F        Dm
From Californication
Am  F   Am  F

Pay your surgeon very well

But this is what you're craving

First born unicorn
Am            F
