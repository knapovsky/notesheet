[Verse 1]

       C              G                 Am          Fmaj7    F6
When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
C                 G              F  C/E Dm C
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

    C              G                 Am              Fmaj7    F6
And in my hour of darkness, She is standing right in front of me
C                 G              F  C/E Dm C
Speaking words of wisdom, Let it be


[Chorus]

        Am        C/G          F          C
Let it be, let it be,  let it be, let it be

 Whisper words of wisdom, let it be


[Verse 2]

       C              G              Am           Fmaj7    F6
And when the broken hearted people, Living in the world agree
C                 G              F  C/E Dm C
There will be an answer, let it be
       C                 G              Am                  Fmaj7    F6
For though they may be parted, There is still a chance that they may see
C                 G              F  C/E Dm C
There will be an answer, let it be


[Chorus]

        Am        C/G          F          C
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
C                G              F  C/E Dm C
There will be an answer, let it be
        Am        C/G          F          C
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
C                G              F  C/E Dm C
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

[Verse 3]

      C                 G
And when the night is cloudy,
                 Am          Fmaj7    F6
There is still a light that shines on me

Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

Let it be, let it be,  let it be, let it be
