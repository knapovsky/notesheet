[Verse 1] 
               A   Bm   D    G         D                     A
The heart is a bloom           Shoots  up  through the stony ground 
           A     Bm   D    G      D                      A
There's no room               No  space  to rent in this town 
              A     Bm   D    G          D                      A 
You're out of luck               And the reason that you had to care
               A     Bm   D    G                D          A
The traffic is stuck             And you're not mo_ving anywhere
                  A         Bm      D    G               D              A
You thought you'd found   a friend           To take you out  of  this  place 
        A     Bm      D        G               D              A
Someone you   could  lend    a hand         In return   for   grace

[Chorus]
                 A5     B5   D5    G5     D5                   A5
It's a beautiful day                        Sky   falls,   you feel  like
                 A5     B5   D5    G5     D5              A5
It's a beautiful day                Don't let  it   get  away

[Verse 2]
              A    Bm   D    G            D              A
You're on the road             But you've got   no  destination
              A    Bm   D    G            D                A
You're in the mud                  In the maze of her  imagina_tion
              A    Bm   D    G            D              A
You love this town                        Even if that   doesn't ring true
            A    Bm  D    G            D                  A
You've been all      over     And it's been   all   over you

[Chorus]
                 A5     B5   D5    G5     D5              A5
It's a beautiful day                Don't let  it get  away
                 A5     B5   D5    G5     D5              A5
It's a beautiful day               

[Bridge]
F#m          G        D               A
Touch    me           Take me to that other  place
F#m          G        D                A
Teach    me           I know I'm not a hopeless case

[Instrumental]
A   Bm   D    G    D   A

[Verse 3]
Em                                    D
See the world   in green and blue     See China right in front of you
Em              G                   D
See the canyons broken by cloud     See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
Em              G                   D
See the Bedouin fires at night      See the oil fields at first light and
Em                  G                  D
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth  after the flood all the colors came out

[Chorus]
                    A5     B5   D5    G5     D5              A5
It was a beautiful  day                Don't let  it   get  away
           A5     B5   D5    G5     D5              A5
Beautiful day

[Bridge]
F#m          G        D               A
Touch    me           Take me to that other place
F#m            G               D                A
Reach            me           I know I'm not a hopeless case

[Outro]
A                        Bm           D       G
 What  you  don't  have  you  don't   need it now  
D                                A
 What  you  don't  know  you can feel   it somehow   
A                        Bm           D       G
 What  you  don't  have  you  don't   need it now
D                                A
 Don't  need  it  now
                 A5     B5   D5    G5     D5              A5
Was a beautiful day
A5     B5   D5    G5     D5              A5
