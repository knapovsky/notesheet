# Norah Jones - Thinking about you
```
D#     Cm           Bb    G#
Yesterday I saw the sun shinin',
D#       Cm                  Bb   G#
And the leaves were fallin' down softly,
Bb       C#             G#
My cold hands needed a warm, warm touch,
Bb          G#            F#
And I was thinkin' about you.


D#     Cm              Bb       G#
Here I am lookin' for signs of leaving,
D#           Cm           Bb         G#
You hold my hand, but do you really need me?
Bb            C#             G#
I guess it's time for me to let you go,
D#              C#            Cm*  C#
And I've been thinkin' about you,
D#          C#        B
I've been thinkin' about you.

D#        Cm             Bb     G#
When you sail across the ocean waters,
D#       Cm           Bb      G#
And you reach the other side safely,
Bb          C#            G#
Could you smile a little smile for me?
D#              C#             Cm*  C#
'cause I'll be thinkin' about you,
D#        C#           B  C#
I'll be thinkin' about you,
D#        C#           Cm*  C#
I'll be thinkin' about you,
D#        C#           B  C#
I'll be thinkin' about you.
