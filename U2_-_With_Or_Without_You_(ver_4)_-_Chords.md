[Intro]
G D Em C
G D Em C

[Verse 1]
G         D                 Em
 See the stone set in your eyes
         C                   G
See the thorn twist in your side
          D       Em    C
And I'll wait for you
G            D                Em
 Sleight of hand and twist of fate
             C                   G
On a bed of nails, she makes me wait
          D        Em      C
And I'll wait, without you
             G    D              Em     C
With or without you, with or without you

[Verse 2]
G             D                  Em
 Through the storm we reach the shore
             C              G
You give it all but I want more
          D      Em     C
And I'm waiting for you

[Chorus]
            G      D         Em           C
With or without you, with or without you I
         G   D             Em     C
I can't live   with or without you

[Bridge]
         G              D            Em            C
And you give yourself away, and you give yourself away
         G              D
And you give, And you give,
         Em            C
And you give yourself away

[Interlude]
G  D  Em  C

[Verse 3]
G              D
 My hands are tied,
Em        C                     G
 my body bruised, she's got me with
            D        Em              C
nothing to win, and nothing left to lose

[Bridge]
         G             D
And you give yourself away
         Em            C
And you give yourself away
         G              D
And you give, And you give,
         Em            C
And you give yourself away

[Chorus]
             G      D
With or without you,
         Em           C
With or without you I
         G   D             Em     C    G
I can't live   with or without you.

[Ending]
G
