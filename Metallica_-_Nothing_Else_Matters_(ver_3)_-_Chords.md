[Intro]

Em     Am   C D  Em
Em D C
Em D C
Em D C
G B7 Em

[Verse]
Em                   D      C
  So close no matter how far
Em                      D             C
  couldn't be much more from the heart
Em                 D       C
  forever trusting who we are
G     B7           Em
  and nothing else matters
Em               D            C
  never opened myself this way
Em                         D      C
  life is ours, we live it our way
Em                  D              C
  all these words I don't just say
G     B7           Em
  and nothing else matters
Em                   D          C
  trust I seek and I find in you
Em                 D            C
  every day for us something new
Em                D             C
  open mind for a different view
G     B7           Em      C  A
  and nothing else matters

[Chorus]
D                        C  A
never cared for what they do
D                        C  A
never cared for what they know
D     Em
but I know

[Verse]
Em                   D      C
  So close no matter how far
Em                      D             C
  couldn't be much more from the heart
Em                 D       C
  forever trusting who we are
G     B7           Em
  and nothing else matters

[Chorus]
D                        C  A
never cared for what they do
D                        C  A
never cared for what they know
D     Em
but I know

[Verse]

  life is ours, we live it our way
Em                  D              C
  all these words I don't just say
G     B7           Em
  and nothing else matters
Em                   D          C
