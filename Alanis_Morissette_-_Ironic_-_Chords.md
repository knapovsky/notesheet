Capo 4th fret


[Verse]

    D  G   D              Em
An old man  turned ninety-eight
            D   G      D            Em
He won the lottery and died the next day
       D     G          D        Em
It´s a black fly in your  Chardonnay
       D         G          D           Em
It´s a death row pardon two minutes too late
          D    G  D               Em
Isn´t it ironic ... don´t you think


[Chorus]

         D   G         D       Em
It´s like rain on your wedding day
            D  G             D       Em
It´s a free ride when you´ve already paid
              D  G            D           Em
It´s the good advice that you just didn´t take
    F          C                  D
Who would´ve thought ... it figures


[Verse]

   D        G       D         Em
Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly
   D          G            D              Em
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye
              D          G       D         Em
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
           D             G
And as the plane crashed down he thought
D                  Em
" Well isn´t this nice ... "
              D    G  D               Em
And isn´t it ironic ... don´t you think


[Chorus]

         D   G         D       Em
It´s like rain on your wedding day
            D  G             D       Em
It´s a free ride when you´ve already paid
              D  G            D           Em
It´s the good advice that you just didn´t take
    F          C                  D
Who would´ve thought ... it figures


[Bridge]

      Cmaj7                  D
Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
                            Cmaj7                       D
When you think everything´s okay and everything´s going right
     Cmaj7                  D
And life has a funny way of helping you out when
                                       Cmaj7
You think everything´s gone wrong and everything blows up
         D
In your face


[Verse]

  D       G              D         Em
A traffic jam when you´re  already late
     D       G            D        Em
A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
          D            G                  D         Em
It´s like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
                  D        G
It´s meeting the man of my dreams
                     D         Em
And then meeting his beautiful wife
              D    G  D               Em
And isn´t it ironic ... don´t you think
        D     G                    D        Em
A little too ironic ... and yeah I really do think ...


[Chorus]

         D   G         D       Em
It´s like rain on your wedding day
            D  G             D       Em
It´s a free ride when you´ve already paid
              D  G            D           Em
It´s the good advice that you just didn´t take
    F          C                  D
Who would´ve thought ... it figures


[Outro]

Cmaj7                   D
Life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
Cmaj7                              D         Cmaj7
Life has a funny, funny way --- of helping you out

Helping you out
