[Intro]

Am G F E


[Verse]
           Am
I remember when,
                                     G
I remember I remember when I lost my mind
                                           F
There was something so pleasant about that place
                                             E
Even your emotions have an echo Into so much space

                    Am
And when you’re out there
                                G
Without care Yeah, I was out of touch
                                      F
But it wasn’t because I didn’t know enough
                E
I just knew too much


[Chorus]

                  Am
Does that make me crazy?
                  G
Does that make me crazy?
                  F
Does that make me crazy?
   E
Possibly


Am
Pa pa pa pe
G
Pa pa pa pe
F
Pa pa pa pe
E
Pa pa pa pe


[Verse]

Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you who do you think you are?
Ha ha ha Bless your soul
You really think you’re in control?


[Chorus]

I think you’re crazy
I think you’re crazy
And I think you’re crazy
Just like me


Pa pa pa pe
Pa pa pa pe
Pa pa pa pe
Pa pa pa pe


[Verse]

Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little and it looked like fun
And it’s no coincidence I’ve come
And I can die when I’m done.


[Chorus]

Maybe I’m crazy
Maybe you’re crazy
Maybe we’re crazy
Probably


Pa pa pa pe
Pa pa pa pe
Pa pa pa pe
Pa pa pa pe
```
