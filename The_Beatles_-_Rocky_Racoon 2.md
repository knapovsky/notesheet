Am7

     Am7
Now somewhere in the Black Mountain Hills of Dakota 
      D7sus                              D7
There lived a young boy name of Rocky Raccoon 
    G7                              C
And one day his woman ran off with another guy 

Hit young Rocky in the eye...
                           Am7                 D7
Rocky didn't like that, he said, "I'm going to get that boy." 
       G7                          G                            C
So one day he walked into town and booked himself a room in the local

saloon.

Am7                  D7
Rocky Racoon checked into his room 
G7                    C
only to find Gideon's Bible 
Am7             D7
Rocky had come equipped with a gun 
   G7                        C
to shoot off the legs of his rival. 
    Am                   D7
His rival, it seems, had broken his dreams 
   G7                       C
by stealing the girl of his fancy 
    Am7                      D7
Her name was Magill, and she called herself 'Lil' 
    G7                   C
But everyone knew her as Nancy. 

    Am7                  D7
Now she and her man (who called himself Dan) 
     G7                      C
Were in the next room at the hoedown 
Am7                 D7
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin, 
          G7                   C
he said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown." 

    Am7                D7
But Daniel was hot. He drew first and shot 
    G7       G             C
and Rocky collapsed in the corner. 

Da-n-da da da-n-da da da... Am7  D7  G7  C  3x

        Am7            D7
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin 
    G7                      C
and proceeded to lie on the table. 

          Am7
He said, "Rocky, you met your match." 
                 D7
But Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch. 
            G7                              G            C
And I'll be better... I'll be better Doc as soon as I am able." 

    Am7                    D7
Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room 
G7                    C
only to find Gideon's bible. 
Am7                        D7
Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt 
   G7                       C
to help with good Rocky's revival. 

Oh yeah, yeah
Da-n-da da da-n-da da da... Am7  D7  G7  C
