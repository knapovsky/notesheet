HELP IS AROUND THE CORNER
By Coldplay
Tabbed by Josh Grant

D                           Bm
Stuck here in the middle of nowhere
D                           Bm
With a head ache and a heavy heart
D                           Bm
Well nothing is going quite right here
D                           Bm     
And I'm tired I can't play my part

G                          E
Come on come on oh what a state I'm in
G                           E
Come on come on why wont it just sink in
D                       Bm          D
Help is just around the corner for us

D                           Bm
Oh my head just wont stop aching
D                           Bm
And I'm sat here licking my wounds
D                           Bm
Well I'm shatered, and it really doesn't matter
D                           Bm             D
Because my rescue will be here soon

G                          E
Come on come on oh what a state I'm in
G                           E
Come on come on why wont it just sink in
D                       Bm          D
Help is just around the corner for us

G                          E
Come on come on oh what a state I'm in
G                           E
Come on come on why wont it just sink in
D                       Bm          D
Help is just around the corner for us
