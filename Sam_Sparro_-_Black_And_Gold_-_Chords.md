       Em
If the fish swam out of the ocean
and grew legs and they started walking
        Cadd9
and the apes climbed down from the trees
         A7sus4                 B7
and grew tall and they started talking
        Em
and the stars fell out of the sky
and my tears rolled into the ocean
        A7sus4
now i'm looking for a reason why
         Cadd9             B7
you even set my world into motion

          Em
'cause if you're not really here
then the stars don't even matter
        Cadd9
now i'm filled to the top with fear
         A7sus4              B7
but it's all just a bunch of matter
          Em
'cause if you're not really here
then i don't want to be either
           Cadd9
i wanna be next to you
          A7sus4
black and gold
          B7
black and gold
          Em
black and gold

Em                 Cadd9      A7sus4 B7

         Em
i looked up into the night sky
and see a thousand eyes staring back
        Cadd9
and all around these golden beacons
A7sus4            B7
i see nothing but black
         Em
i feel a way of something beyond them
i don't see what i can feel
    Cadd9
if vision is the only validation
     A7sus4                B7
then most of my life isn't real

          Em
'cause if you're not really here
then the stars don't even matter
        Cadd9
now i'm filled to the top with fear
         A7sus4              B7
but it's all just a bunch of matter
          Em
'cause if you're not really here
then i don't want to be either
           Cadd9
i wanna be next to you
          A7sus4
black and gold
          B7
black and gold
          Em
black and gold

And repeat the chord progression as neccasary :)
