Always look on the bright Side of Life
Monti Python


[Verse]

     Am                 D            G               Em
Some things in life are bad they can really make you mad
      Am                   D         G
Other things just make you swear and curse
            Am                D
When you've chewing an life's gristle
      G              Em
Don't grumble give a whistle
    Am                                   D7
And this'll help things turn out for the best


[Chorus]

    G      Em          Am     D7      G      Em    Am    D7
And always look on the bright side of life
   G   Em          Am    D7      G     Em    Am    D7
Always look on the light side of life


[Verse]

   Am               D              G                Em
If life seems jolly rotten there's something you've forgotten
              Am                  D         G
and that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing.
            Am             D              G     Em
When you've feeling in the dumps don't be silly chumps
     Am                                       D7
Just purse your lips and whistle - that's the thing


[Chorus]

    G      Em          Am     D7      G      Em    Am    D7
And always look on the bright side of life
           G   Em          Am    D7        G     Em    Am    D7
Come on always look on the bright side of life


[Verse]

     Am               D        G               Em
For life is quite absurd and death's the final word
         Am              D              G
you must always face the curtain with a bow
   Am             D              G          Em
Forget about your sin - give the audience a grin
  Am                                D7
Enjoy it - it's your last chance anyhow.


[Chorus]

    G      Em          Am     D7      G      Em    Am    D7
So always look on the bright side of death
G      Em       Am           D7    G         Em    Am    D7
just before you draw your terminal breath


[Verse]

Am               D    G                Em
Life's a pice if shit when you look at it
Am                 D                   G
Life's a laugh and death's a joke it's true
       Am             D
You'll see it's all a show
        G               Em
keep'em laughing as you go
       Am                               D7
just remember that the last laugh is on you


[Chorus]

    G      Em          Am     D7      G     Em    Am    D7
And always look on the bright side of life
G      Em          Am    D7      G      Em    Am    D7
Always look on the right side of life
(Come on guys, cheer up)
A      F#          Bm    E7      A     F#    Bm    E7
Always look on the right side of life
A      F#          Bm    E7      A     F#    Bm    E7
Always look on the right side of life ....
