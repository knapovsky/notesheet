[Intro]

Em7 G  D4 Cadd9


[Verse]

    Em7 G      D4 Cadd9
Hello,   it's me
       Em7         G                D4
I was wondering if after all these years
               Cadd9      Em7 G       D4  Cadd9
You'd like to meet, to go over everything
               Em7                G
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
             D4        Cadd9
But I ain't done much healing

    Em7 G         D4    Cadd9
Hello,   can you hear me?
        Em7         G              D4            Cadd9
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
              Em7   G      D4 Cadd9
When we were younger and free
      Em7              G               D4                Cadd9
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet


[Pre-Chorus]

                Em7  D4       Bm  Cadd9
There's such a difference between us
       Em7 D4  Cadd9
And a million miles


[Chorus]

 Em7         Cadd9    G  D4
Hello from the other side
   Em7               Cadd9   G   D4
I must've called a thousand times
         Em7     Cadd9            G              D4
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
            Em7      Cadd9 G          D4
But when I call you never seem to be home

 Em7         Cadd9 G  D4
Hello from the outside
    Em7              Cadd9     G  D4
At least I can say that I've tried
         Em7     Cadd9       G            D4
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
                 Em7      Cadd9          G         D4      Em7 G D4 Cadd9
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore


[Verse]

    Em7 G    D4   Cadd9
Hello,   how are you?
         Em7        G           D4          Cadd9
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
   Em7 G             D4 Cadd9
I hope  that you're well
        Em7          G                       D4           Cadd9
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?


[Pre-Chorus]

         Em7  D4         Bm     Cadd9   Em7    D4      Cadd9
It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time


[Chorus]

 Em7         Cadd9    G  D4
Hello from the other side
   Em7               Cadd9   G   D4
I must've called a thousand times
         Em7     Cadd9            G              D4
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
            Em7      Cadd9 G          D4
But when I call you never seem to be home

 Em7         Cadd9 G  D4
Hello from the outside
    Em7              Cadd9     G  D4
At least I can say that I've tried
         Em7     Cadd9       G            D4
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
                 Em7      Cadd9          G         D4      Em7 Cadd9
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore


[Interlude]

 D4 G        Em7 Cadd9
Ooooohh, anymore
 D4 G        Em7 Cadd9
Ooooohh, anymore
 D4 G        Em7 Cadd9
Ooooohh, anymore
    D4 G
Anymore


[Chorus]

 Em7         Cadd9    G  D4
Hello from the other side
   Em7               Cadd9   G   D4
I must've called a thousand times
         Em7     Cadd9            G              D4
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
            Em7      Cadd9 G          D4
But when I call you never seem to be home

 Em7         Cadd9 G  D4
Hello from the outside
    Em7              Cadd9     G  D4
At least I can say that I've tried
         Em7     Cadd9       G            D4
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
                 Em7      Cadd9          G         D4      Em7 G D4 Cadd9 Em7
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
