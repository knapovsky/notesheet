Stand By Me chords
Ben E. King 1961 *

A  F#m  D  E   A

A
When the night has come
F#m
And the land is dark
        D           E                A
And the moon is the only light we'll see
A                          F#m
No I won't be afraid, oh I won't be afraid
        D           E               A
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

A                                    F#m
So darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
   D     E         A
oh stand, stand by me, stand by me

A
If the sky that we look upon
F#m
Should tumble and fall
        D                E              A
And the mountains should crumble to the sea
A                              F#m
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
        D           E               A
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

A                                    F#m
So darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
   D        E          A
oh stand now, stand by me, stand by me

A F#m D E A  2x

A                                    F#m
So darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh stand by me
   D        E          A
oh stand now, stand by me, stand by me

A
Whenever you're in trouble just stand by me
   F#m              D            E               A
oh stand by me, woa stand now oh stand, stand by me

When all . . .
