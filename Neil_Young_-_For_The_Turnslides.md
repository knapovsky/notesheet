[Intro]

G F D D (x2)

[Verse 1]
G F D D
All the sailors with their seasick mamas
G F D D
hear the sirens on the shore
G F D D
singing songs for pimps with tailors
C G D D
who charge ten dollars at the door

[Chorus]
G F D D
You can really learn a lot that way
G F D D
it will change you in the middle of the day
G F D D
Though your confidence may be shattered
C G D D
it doesn't matter

[Verse 2]
G F D D
All the great explorers
G F D D
are now in Granite Lake
G F D D
under white sheets for the great unveiling
C G D D
at the big... parade

[Chorus]
G F D D
You can really learn a lot that way
G F D D
it will change you in the middle of the day
G F D D
Though your confidence may be shattered
C G D D
it doesn't matter

[Instrumental]

G F D G F D G F D

[Verse 3]
G F D D
All the bush-league batters
G F D D
are left to die on the diamond
G F D D
In the stands the home crowd scatters
C G D D
For the turnstiles
C G D D
For the turnstiles
C G D D
For the turnstiles

[Outro]
