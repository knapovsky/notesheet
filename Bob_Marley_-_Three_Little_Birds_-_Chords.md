[Intro]
A

[Chorus]
         A
Don't worry, about a thing
       D                              A
Cause' every little thing, gonna be alright
        A
Singin' don't worry, about a thing
       D                              A
Cause' every little thing, gonna be alright

[Verse]
A
Rise up this mornin'
               E
Smile with the rising sun
             A                 D
Three little birds perch by my doorstep
        A
Singin' sweet songs
           E
of melodys pure and true
       D                   A
sayin', this my message to you-oo-oo

[Chorus]
        A
Singin' don't worry, about a thing
       D                                   A
Cause' every little thing, (is) gonna be alright
        A
Singin' don't worry, (don't worry) about a thing
       D                              A
Cause' every little thing, gonna be alright
