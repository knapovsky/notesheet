Yesterday
The Beatles


[Verse]
F         Em7     A7                  Dm       Dm7  Bb
Yesterday, All my troubles seemed so far away,
        C       C7                F
Now it looks as though they're here to stay,
C   Dm7  G7       Bb   F
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
F         Em7     A7             Dm         Dm7  Bb
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
          C      C7      F
There's a shadow hanging over me,
C   Dm7   G7       Bb    F
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.


[Chorus]
A7add11  A7  Dm  C  Bb
Why   she had to go,
Dm      C         C7       F
I don't know, she wouldn't say.
A7add11 A7   Dm  C     Bb
I    said something wrong,
Dm    C        C7    F
Now I long for yesterday.


[Verse]
F           Em7     A7           Dm           Dm7  Bb
Yesterday, Love was such an easy game to play,
      C      C7       F
Now I need a place to hide away,
C   Dm7  G7      Bb    F
Oh, I believe in yesterday.


[Chorus]
A7add11  A7  Dm  C  Bb
Why   she had to go,
Dm      C         C7       F
I don't know, she wouldn't say.
A7add11 A7   Dm   C    Bb
I    said something wrong,
Dm    C        C7    F
Now I long for yesterday.


[Verse]
F           Em7     A7           Dm           Dm7  Bb
Yesterday, Love was such an easy game to play,
      C      C7       F
Now I need a place to hide away,
C   Dm7  G7      Bb    F
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
     Dm     G7        Bb      F
Humm Hum-mm Humm Humm Humm-mm Humm
