```
[Chorus]

Em                            Am
Strumming my pain with his fingers
D7                           G
singing my life with his words
Em                      A
killing me softly with his song
               D           C
killing me softly with his song
           G                   C
telling my whole life with his words.
               Esus4
Killing me softly
             E
with his song.


[Verse]

Am7          D
I heard he sang a good song
G          C
I heard he had a style
Am7        D
and so I came to see him
   Em
to listen for a while.
Am7            D7
And there he was this young boy
G          B7
a stranger to my eyes.


[Chorus]

Em                            Am
Strumming my pain with his fingers
D7                           G
singing my life with his words
Em                      A
killing me softly with his song
               D           C
killing me softly with his song
           G                   C
telling my whole life with his words.
               Esus4
Killing me softly
             E
with his song.


[Verse]

Am7          D
I felt all flushed with fever
G          C
embarrassed by the crowd.
Am7        D
I felt he found my letters
    Em
and read each one out loud.
Am7            D7
I prayed that he would finish
G                      B7
but he just kept right on.


[Chorus]

Em                            Am
Strumming my pain with his fingers
D7                           G
singing my life with his words
Em                      A
killing me softly with his song
               D           C
killing me softly with his song
           G                   C
telling my whole life with his words.
               Esus4
Killing me softly
             E
with his song.


[Verse]

Am7        D
He sang as if he knew me
G          C
in all my dark despair.
Am7         D
And then he looked right through me
   Em
as if I wasn't there.
Am7         D7
And he just kept on singing
G                   B7
singing clear and strong.


[Chorus]

Em                            Am
Strumming my pain with his fingers
D7                           G
singing my life with his words
Em                      A
killing me softly with his song
               D           C
killing me softly with his song
           G                   C
telling my whole life with his words.
               Esus4
Killing me softly
             E
with his song.


Em    Am
Ooooh oooh,
D7        G
Ooooh, ooooh
Em            A
La la la, la la la
D         C
Ooooh oooh
G      C       Esus4
Laaaaah...
E
Laaaaaaah


Em                            Am
Strumming my pain with his fingers
D7                           G
singing my life with his words
Em                      A
killing me softly with his song
               D           C
killing me softly with his song
           G                   C
telling my whole life with his words.
               Esus4
Killing me softly

E


[Ending]

Em                       Am
He was strumming my pain
D7                   G
Yeah, he was singing my life
Em                      A
killing me softly with his song
               D           C
killing me softly with his song
           G                   C
telling my whole life with his words.
               Esus4
Killing me softly
             E
with his song.
