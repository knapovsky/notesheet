It's my first tab, so be indulgent!

It can be played in capo 4 as well whithout any, as you like.

Exepted the chords between (), each chord is preceded by the first string of the
chord. Example : The chord Em is played as this : the first string (E) is played,
and the 5 other are played after; the E string, and the 5 others angain. As this,
each chord is played twice! The chords between [] are played once.

[Intro]

Am Em Am Em Dm Em Am  [ Em ]  ( Am )


[Verse]

      Am             Em
I'm sitting here in a boring room,
     Am                        Em
It's just another rainy sunday afternoon.
    Am              Em
I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to do.
    Am                 Em
I'm hanging around, I'm waiting for you,
    Dm             Em           Am       [ Em ] ( Am )
But nothing ever happens - and I wonder.

      Am             Em
I'm driving around in my car,
     Am                        Em
I'm driving too fast, I'm driving too far.
    Am              Em
I'd like to change my point of view
    Am                 Em
I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you
    Dm             Em           Am       [ Em ] ( Am )
But nothing ever happens - and I wonder.


[Chorus]

  C             G
I wonder how, I wonder why
Am                              Em
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
    F              G                    C           G7
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.
    C               G
I'm turning my head up and down,
Am                                  Em
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
    F              F#dim                     G       G7
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.


[Interlude]

Am  Am  Em  Em  Am  Am  Em  Em  Dm  Dm  Em  Em  Am    [ Em ] ( Am )
Dam     dadoudi....


[Verse]

      Am             Em
I'm sitting here, I miss the power.
     Am              Em
I'd like to go out, taking a shower,
    Am                    Em
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head.
    Am                 Em
I feel so tired, put myself to bed,
    Dm             Em           Am       [ Em ] ( Am )
Where nothing ever happens - and I wonder.


[Bridge]

E           Am
Isolation - Is not good for me,
G           C                       E
Isolation - I don't want to sit on a lemon tree.


[Verse]

    Am                   Em
I'm stepping around in a desert of joy
Am                     Em
Baby anyhow I'll get another toy
    Dm             Em           Am       [ Em ] ( Am )
And everything will happen - and I will wonder.


[Chorus]

  C             G
I wonder how, I wonder why
Am                              Em
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
    F              G                    C           G7
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.
    C               G
I'm turning my head up and down,
Am                                  Em
I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
    F              F#dim                     G       G7
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.     (And I wonder..., I wonder...)

  C             G
I wonder how, I wonder why
Am                              Em
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
    F              G        F              G
And all that I can see, And all that I can see,
    F              G     G 7            C
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.
