    _________________
   / Duffy          /  I think this song is about a girl who wants her husband
  / Syrup & Honey  /  to quit spending his time on all the sweet things in life
 / Rockferry      /  and instead come back home to love her. I love this song
/________________/  for its simplicity and for displaying Duffy's full vocal
                   potential.

Time: 6/8 shuffled
Tempo: Q=67 bpm
The guitar part is Bernard Butler improvising on these chords in Hendrix-style.

 LYRICS
**********
Don't you be wasting all your money on syrup and honey
Because I'm sweet enough
Don't you be using every minute on making a living
Because we've got our love
Listen to me, 1, 2, 3
Baby, baby, baby, spend your time on me

Don't you be out all night long leaving me all alone
Because I, I need your love
Don't spending every day working away
Because I'm waiting for you
Listen to me, 1, 2, 3
Baby, baby, baby, spend your time on me
