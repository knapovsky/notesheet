Capo 2

[Verse 1]

Am
Oh baby, baby
     E                 C
How was I supposed to know
      Dm               E
That something wasn't right here
Am
Oh baby baby
     E                   C
I shouldn't have let you go
     Dm                E
And now you're out of sight, yeah


[Pre-Chorus]

Am                       E
Show me, how you want it to be
         C
Tell me baby
                  Dm                E
'Cause I need to know now what we've got


[Chorus]

Am                E
My loneliness is killing me
C                   Dm             E
I must confess, I still believe (still believe)
Am                       E
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
C
Give me a sign
Dm          E                   Am
Hit me baby one more time


[Verse 2]

Am
Oh baby, baby
     E                 C
The reason I breathe is you
 Dm               E
Boy you've got me flying
Am
Oh pretty baby
         E               C
There's no-thing that I wouldn't do
     Dm              E
It's not the way I planned it


[Pre-Chorus]

Am                       E
Show me, how you want it to be
         C
Tell me baby
                  Dm                E
'Cause I need to know now what we've got


[Chorus]

Am                E
My loneliness is killing me
C                   Dm             E
I must confess, I still believe (still believe)
Am                       E
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
C
Give me a sign
Dm          E                   Am
Hit me baby one more time


[Interlude]

Am
Oh baby, baby
     E                 C      Dm  E
How was I supposed to know
F                    G
Oh pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you
F          G    {Palm Mute}
Gooooooooooooo


[Bridge]

            Am                 E
I must confess, that my loneliness
               C              Dm      E      Am
Is killing me now, don't you know I still believe
                  E
That you will be here
               C
Now give me a sign
Dm          E
Hit me baby one more time


[Chorus]

Am                E
My loneliness is killing me
C                   Dm             E
I must confess, I still believe (still believe)
Am                       E
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
C
Give me a sign
Dm          E
Hit me baby one more time
