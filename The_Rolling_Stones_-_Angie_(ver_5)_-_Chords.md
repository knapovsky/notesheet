[Verse]

Am     E7     G               F               C
Angie, Angie, when will those clouds all disappear?
Am     E7     G             F            C
Angie, Angie, where will it lead us from here?
        G                          Dm           Am
With no loving in our souls and no money in our coats
C         F              G
You can't say we're satisfied
    Am     E7     G         F            C
But Angie, Angie, you can't say we never tried

Am            E7         G            F                 C
Angie, you're beautiful, but ain't it time we said good-bye?
Am             E7        G        F                   C
Angie, I still love you, remember all those nights we cried?
        G                                 Dm           Am
All the dreams we held so close seemed to all go up in smoke
C      F               G
Let me whisper in your ear:
Am     E7     G             F            C
Angie, Angie, where will it lead us from here?

    G                               Dm                 Am
Oh, Angie, don't you weep, all your kisses still taste sweet
C           F               G
I hate that sadness in your eyes
    Am     E7     G        F                 C
But Angie, Angie, ain't it time we said good-bye?
        G                          Dm           Am
With no loving in our souls and no money in our coats
C         F              G
You can't say we're satisfied

    Dm                       Am
But Angie, I still love you, baby
Dm                           Am
Ev'rywhere I look I see your eyes
Dm                             Am
There ain't a woman that comes close to you
C       F              G
Come on Baby, dry your eyes
    Am     E7     G        F           C
But Angie, Angie, ain't it good to be alive?
Am     E7     G          F            C     Dm C
Angie, Angie, they can't say we never tried
