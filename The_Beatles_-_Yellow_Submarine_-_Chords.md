[Verse]

G      D          C     G
In the town where I was born
Em      Am       C        D
Lived a man who sailed to sea
G      D       C      G
And he told us of his life
Em     Am      C    D
In the land of submarines

G     D         C      G
So we sailed up to the sun
Em      Am        C      D
Till we found the sea of green
G      D       C         G
And we lived beneath the waves
Em     Am     C    D
In our yellow submarine


[Chorus]

G                D
We all live in a yellow submarine
D                 G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
G                D
We all live in a yellow submarine
D                 G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine


[Verse]

G       D           C      G
And our friends are all on board
Em   Am           C         D
Many more of them live next door
G       D      C       G
And the band begins to play

Em      Am       C       D


[Chorus]

G                D
We all live in a yellow submarine
D                 G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
G                D
We all live in a yellow submarine
D                 G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine


[Instrumental] (Verse chords)

G D C G Em Em Am C D
G D C G Em Em Am C D


[Verse]

G     D      C       G
As we live a life of ease
Em   Am            C      D
Everyone of us has all we need
G      D        C      G
Sky of blue and sea of green
Em     Am     C    D
In our yellow submarine


[Chorus]

G                D
We all live in a yellow submarine
D                 G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
G                D
We all live in a yellow submarine
D                 G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

G                D
We all live in a yellow submarine
D                 G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
G                D
We all live in a yellow submarine
D                 G
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
