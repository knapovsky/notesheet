title: Coldplay - Help is Round The Corner
---

```
Stuck here in the middle of nowhere
With a headache and a heavy heart
Well, nothing was going quite right here
And I'm tired, I can't play no part
Oh, come on, come on
Oh, what a state I'm in
Oh, come on, come on
Why won't it just sink in?
Help is just around the corner for us
Oh, my head just won't stop achin'
And I'm sad here lickin' my wounds
And I'm shattered but it really doesn't matter
'Cause my rescue is gonna be here soon
Oh, come on, come on
Oh, what a state I'm in
Oh, come on, come on
Why won't it just sink in?
Help is just around the corner for us
That help is just around the corner for us
Oh that, help is just around the corner for us
