 E                 Bm7           Asus4        A
No change  I can change  I can change  I can change
         E          Bm7         Asus4         A
But I'm here in my mould  I am here in my mould.
           E                 Bm7        Asus4          A
But I'm a million different people from one day to the next

           E         Bm7         Asus4        A       E     Bm7  Asus4  A
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me yeah
           E       Bm7           Asus4     A           E     Bm7  Asus4   A
I let the melody shine  let it cleanse my mind  I feel free now
           E          Bm7              Asus4     A       E     Bm7     Asus4  A
but the airwaves are clean and there's nobody singing to me now

[Chorus]
 E                 Bm7           Asus4        A
No change  I can change  I can change  I can change
         E          Bm7         Asus4         A
But I'm here in my mould  I am here in my mould.
           E                 Bm7        Asus4          A
And I'm a million different people from one day to the next
              E         Bm7     Asus4     A    E  Bm7  Asus4  A  E  Bm7  Asus4  A
I can't change my mould no  no  no  no  no  no  no (have you ever been down?)

        Trying to make ends meet, trying to find some money then you die.
Asus4  A              E        Bm7   Asus4     A         E   Bm7
        I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down

You know I can change  I can change  I can change  I can change
         E          Bm7         Asus4         A
But I'm here in my mould  I am here in my mould.

(It’s just sex and violence, melody and silence)

(I’ll take you down the only road I've ever been down)

(Been down)
(Ever been down)
