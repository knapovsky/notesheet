City's breaking down on a camels back.
Am                        C
City's breaking down on a camels back.

[chorus]
C                   Am
Windmill, windmill for the land.
G              D
Turn forever, hand in hand.
C                  Am
Take it all there, on your stride.
G              D
It's ticking, falling down.

Love forever, love is free.

Lets turn forever, you and me.

Care bear bumping in the heart of this here.

Watch me as I gravitate.

With yo sound, you're in the place.
G
You gonna bite the dust, can't fight with us.
D
With your sound, you kill the INC.

So don't stop, get it, get it.

Until you're cheddar header.

Watch me as I gravitate.

Ha ha ha. So.
