E                              D
I'll go for a ride wherever it takes me
                    E
You won't fade away
                         D      E
I'm trying to hear your voice
                        D
Clear my head whatever happened
                     E
Slowing my world down
                              D
It's not that I don't have a choice


      F#m
And I feel like time is slipping away
       E
As the years roll on I've got nothing to say
      F#m                       D
And I wish I had it all sorted out


A                              E
 Despite the mess despite the fall
              F#m
You are in control
              D
You are in control
A                            E
 Despite the man who lost it all
              F#m
You are in control
              D
You are in control
        E     D
Of it all


E                                          D
Well I stare at the sand and look at the numbers
                         E
What else could this mean
                          D
Well it's too much for my world alone


      F#m
And I feel like time is slipping away
       E
As the years roll on I've got nothing to say
      F#m                       D
And I wish I had it all sorted out


A                              E
 Despite the mess despite the fall
              F#m
You are in control
              D
You are in control
A                            E
 Despite the man who lost it all
              F#m
You are in control
              D
You are in control
        E     D
Of it all
        E     D
Of it all


      F#m
And I feel like time is slipping away
       E
As the years roll on I've got nothing to say
      F#m                       D
And I wish I had it all sorted out


         A
When my world comes crashing down and I look through

All that I know and I feel that I can't move
E
On in my life cos I'm barely breathing
                                     F#m
And all I know is the hole I'm seeing

Still You will find me standing

Firm cos I know that you have a hand in
D
Everything so I know that I'm giving

You control of the world I live in


A
You are in control
E                        F#m
You are in control of it all
      D
Of it all
```
