[Intro]
|Em  D  G|        |
|C       |G  D    |
|Em  D  G|        |

[Verse 1]
Em         D         G
  Tell me somethin' girl
C                       G       D
  Are you happy in this modern world?
Em         D         G
    Or do you need more
C                              G         D
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

[Refrain]
Em  D  G
I'm fallin'
C
 In all the good times
  G      D            Em   D   G
I find myself longin'      for change
C                       G      D
 And in the bad times I fear myself

|Em  D  G|        |
|Em  D  G|        |

[Verse 2]
Em         D         G
Tell me something boy
C                           G         D
Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void?
Em    D          G
Or do you need more
C                        G      D
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

[Refrain]
Em  D  G
I'm falling
C
 In all the good times
  G       D           Em   D   G
I find myself longing      for change
C                       G      D
 And in the bad times I fear myself

[Chorus]
Am
I'm off the deep end
D
Watch as I dive in
 G          D       Em
I'll never meet the ground
Am
Crash through the surface
D
Where they can't hurt us
       G             D      Em
We're far from the shallow now

[Bridge]
Am               D
   In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
G         D        Em
   In the sha-sha-la-la-la-low
Am               D
   In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
      G              D      Em
We're far from the shallow now

(GAGA BUILD UP)
Em    Bm         D      A     Em     Bm     D      A
      oooohhhhh   oahhhhhhh,   oahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

[Chorus] (strum once and hold)
Am
I'm off the deep end
D
Watch as I dive in
 G          D       Em
I'll never meet the ground
Am
Crash through the surface
D
Where they can't hurt us
       G            D      Em
We're far from the shallow now

[Outro]
Am               D
   In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
G         D        Em
   In the sha-sha-la-la-la-low
Am               D
   In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
      G              D      Em     Em
We're far from the shallow now
