[Verse]

Em                     G               D
No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man,
          C          A
To be the sad man, behind blue eyes
Em                     G          D
No one knows what it's like to be hated,
      C                 A
To be fated, to telling only lies


[Chorus]

       C  D                   G
But my dreams, they aren't as empty,
      C          D        E
As my conscience seems to be
       Bm           C
I have hours, only lonely
           D                      A
My love is vengeance that's never free


[Verse]

Em                     G                  D
No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings
       C       A
Like I do, and I blame you
Em                   G             D
No one bites back as hard on their anger
        C                A
None of my pain and woe, can show through


[Chorus]

       C  D                   G
But my dreams, they aren't as empty,
      C          D        E
As my conscience seems to be
       Bm           C
I have hours, only lonely
           D                      A
My love is vengeance that's never free


[Verse]

Em                     G
No one knows what its like
           D              C
To be mistreated, to be defeated
A
Behind blue eyes
Em                   G
No one knows how to say
              D              C
That they're sorry and don't worry
A
I'm not telling lies


[Chorus]

       C  D                   G
But my dreams, they aren't as empty,
      C          D        E
As my conscience seems to be
       Bm           C
I have hours, only lonely
           D                      A
My love is vengeance that's never free


[Outro]

Em                     G               D
No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man,
          C          A
To be the sad man, behind blue eyes
