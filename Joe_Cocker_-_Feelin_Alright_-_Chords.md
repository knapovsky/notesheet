          C7                    F7
          Seems I got to have a change of scene
          C7                           F7
          Cause every night I have the strangest dreams
          C7                       F7
          Imprisoned by the way it could've been
          C7                     F7
          Left here on my own or so it seems
          C7                      F7
          I got to leave before I start to scream
          C7                                F7
          But someone's locked the door and took the key

                  C7           F7
          Feelin' alright
                          C7                 F7
          Not feelin' too good myself
                  C7           F7
          Feelin' alright
                          C7                 F7
          Not feelin' too good myself


          Boy you sure took me for one big ride

          Even now I sit and wonder why

          And when I think of you I start to cry

          I just can't waste the time I must keep dry

          Got to stop believin' in all your lies

          Cause I got to much to do before I die


           Don't get too lost in all I say

          If half the time I really felt that way

          That was then and now it's today

          Can't get off yet and so I'm here to stay

          Before someone comes along and takes my place

          With a different name and yes a different face
