[Verse]

G              D               Am
Momma take this badge away from me
G        D            C
I don't use it anymore
G                      D                Am
     It's getting dark  to   dark to see
G               D                    C
Feel I'm knocking on heavens door


[Chorus]

G           D                   Am
Knock knock knocking on heavens door
G           D                    C
Knock knock knocking on heavens door
G           D                    Am
Knock knock knocking on heavens door
G           D                   C
Knock knock knocking on heavens door


[Verse]

G         D                  Am
Momma take these guns away from me
G       D               C
I can't shoot them anymore
G           D               Am
That long black cloud is coming down
G       D                    C
Feel I'm knocking on heavens door


[Chorus]

G           D                   Am
Knock knock knocking on heavens door
 G          D                   C
Knock knock knocking on heavens door
G           D                    Am
Knock knock knocking on heavens door
G           D                    C
Knock knock knocking on heavens door
