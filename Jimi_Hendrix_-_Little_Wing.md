# Jimi Hendrix - Little Wing

Capo 1st fret

```
It's not exactly what Jimi Hendrix did, but it's an easy version that i pieced
together from what's already out there... Hopefully you can have some fun with it.

With a circus mind that's running wild
Bm                     Bbm7  Am                 C
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams, and fairy tales

With a thousand smiles she gives to me free

It's alright, it's alright she says

Take anything you want from me

Anything
