Capo: 2 Fret

[Verse 1]

Em                        A
I want you to know that I'm happy for you.
Em                        A
I wish nothing but the best for you both.
        Em                       
Another version of me Is she perverted like me?
             A                  
Would she go down on you in a theatre?
               Em                         
Does she speak eloquently? And would she have your baby?
               A                        
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother.


[Pre-Chorus]

           Em
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
              G                            A              A
wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide. No,
Em
and every time you speak her name
         G                 
does she know how you told me you'd hold me
   A
until you died? `Til you died,
but you're still alive.


[Chorus]

        E            D
And I'm here to remind you
           G                      A
of the mess you left when you went away.
         E        D
It's not fair to deny me
         G                   A
of the cross I bear that you gave to me.
A     
You, you, you oughta know.


[Verse 2]

You seem very well. 
Things look peaceful.
I'm not quite as well. 
I thought you should know.

Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity?
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner.
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced,
and are you thinking of me when you fuck her?


[Pre-Chorus]

           Em
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
              G                            A              A
wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide. No,
Em
and every time you speak her name
         G                 
does she know how you told me you'd hold me
   A
until you died? `Til you died,
but you're still alive.


[Chorus]

        E            D
And I'm here to remind you
           G                      A
of the mess you left when you went away.
         E        D
It's not fair to deny me
         G                   A
of the cross I bear that you gave to me.
A     
You, you, you oughta know.


[Verse 3]

Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me,
and I'm not gonna fade as soon as you close your eyes, and you know it.
And every time I scratch my nails down                  
someone else's back
I hope you feel it. Can you feel it?


[Chorus]

        E            D
And I'm here to remind you
           G                      A
of the mess you left when you went away.
         E        D
It's not fair to deny me
         G                   A
of the cross I bear that you gave to me.
A     
You, you, you oughta know.
