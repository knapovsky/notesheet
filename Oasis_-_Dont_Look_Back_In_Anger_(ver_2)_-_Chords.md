[Intro]

C Fmaj7


[Verse 1]

C               G               Am
Slip inside the eye of your mind
          E7             F     G
Don't you know you might find
                    C        Am  G
A better place to play


[Verse 2]

C             G               Am
You said that you'd never been
            E7                 F    G
But all the things that you've seen
            C         Am  G
Slowly fade away


[Prechorus]

F            Fm                 C
So I start a revolution from my bed
F                Fm                       C
Cos you said the brains I have went to my head
F                Fm              C
Step outside the summertime's in bloom
G
Stand up beside the fireplace
E7
Take that look from off your face
Am                 G                F             G
Cos you ain't ever going to burn my heart ouuuuuuuuuut


[Chorus]

C   G        Am        E7             F
So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late
         G          C    Am  G
As we're walking on by

C        G      Am        E7         F
Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger
  G         C    Am  G
I heard you say


[Instrumental]

C      G        Am    E7    F    G     C    Am G


[Verse 3]

C               G               Am
Take me to the place where you go
          E7             F     G
Where nobody knows
                    C   Am G
If it's night or day


[Verse 4]

C               G               Am
Please don't put your life in the hands
          E7             F     G
Of a Rock and Roll band
                    C     Am G
Who'll throw it all away


[Prechorus]

F            Fm                 C
So I start a revolution from my bed
F                Fm                       C
Cos you said the brains I have went to my head
F                Fm              C
Step outside the summertime's in bloom
G
Stand up beside the fireplace
E7*
Take that look from off your face
Am                 G                F             G
Cos you ain't ever going to burn my heart ouuuuuuuuuut


[Chorus]

C   G        Am        E7             F
So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late
         G          C
As we're walking on by
C        G      Am        E7         F
Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger
  G         C
I heard you say
