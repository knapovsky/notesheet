```
[Verse 1]
       D            G          D
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
                         A7
that saved a wretch like me.
     D                G       D
I once was lost, but now am found,
               A7     D
was blind, but now I see.

[Verse 2]
    D                        G       D
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
                      A7
and grace my fears relieved.
       D           G          D
How precious did that grace appear,
            A7     D
the hour I first believed.

[Verse 3]
 D                           G       D
When we've been there ten thousand years,
 D                     A7
bright shining as the sun,
  D                     G           D
We've no less days to sing God's praise
  D       A7         D
than when we first begun.

[Verse 1]
D            G          D
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
                         A7
That saved a wretch like me.
     D                G       D
I once was lost, but now am found,
               A7     D
Was blind, but now I see.
