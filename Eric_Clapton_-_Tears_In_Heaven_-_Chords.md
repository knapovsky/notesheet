[Intro]
A   E/G#   F#m   D   E7sus4 E7  A

[Chorus]
 A         E       F#m
Would you know my name,
D    A             E
If I saw you in heaven,
  A      E       F#m
Would it be the same,
 D    A            E
If I saw you in heaven,

[Verse]
F#m          C#
I must be strong,
Em         F#
and carry on,
         Bm             E7
Cause I know I don't belong,
           A
Here in heaven.
