[Intro]

C       F       C       F


[Verse 1]

C               G            Am
Slip inside the eye of your mind
          E               F
Don't you know you might find
G                     C      Am G
   A better place to play
C             G            Am
You said that you'd never been
            E                  F
But all the things that you've seen
G               C     Am G
   Slowly fade away


[Pre-Chorus]

F                   Fm             C
  So I start a revolution from my bed
        F                 Fm             C
Cos you said the brains I had went to my head
F                 Fm               C
Step outside, the summertime's in bloom
G
Stand up beside the fireplace
E/G#
Take that look from off your face
    Am             G             F       G
Cos you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out


[Chorus]

C  G         Am        E              F
So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late
          G          C   Am G
as she's walking on by
    C    G        Am              F             G
Her soul slides away,   but don't look back in anger
             C     G    Am    E    F    G     C     Am G
I heard you say


[Verse 2]

C               G            Am
Take me to the place where you go
       E       F   G                  C    Am G
Where nobody knows, if it's night or day
C                      G            Am
Please don't put your life in the hands
      E             F   G                     C    Am G
of a rock and roll band, who'll throw it all away


[Pre-Chorus]

F                Fm                  C
   Gonna start a revolution from my bed
        F               Fm               C
Cos you said the brains I had went to my head
F                  Fm              C
Step outside, the summertime's in bloom
G
Stand up beside the fireplace
E/G#
Take that look from off your face
    Am             G             F     G
Cos you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out


[Chorus]

C  G         Am        E             F
So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late
          G         C   Am G
as she's walking on by
     C    G       Am  E               F             G
Her soul slides away,   but don't look back in anger
             C    Am G
I heard you say

So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late
          G          C   Am G
as she's walking on by
    C    G        Am  E               F             G
Her soul slides away,   but don't look back in anger
             C    Am G
I heard you say
C  G         Am        E             F
So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late
          G          C   Am G
as she's walking on by
C        G        Am
Her soul slides away
               F
But don't look back in anger
           Fm
Don't look back in anger
            C    G   Am   E  F   Fm             C
I heard you say                      least not today
